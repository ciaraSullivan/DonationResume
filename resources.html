                  <h3>Using Donation Builder</h3>
                  <p>How does this work? How will this help me donate?</p>
                  <h5>How to Use</h5>
                  <p>The Donation Builder tool is designed to guide you through the process of donating item(s) to an institution and make it as simple as possible. Each section will give you information on what the fields mean and why they are important, all you have to do is fill them out as fully as possible. Once you have completed the form, you will be able to download the completed Donation Resume as a PDF or TXT document for maximum flexibility. Each institution will have a slightly different process, so we want to make it as easy as possible for you to submit the information you’ve written.
                  
                  We understand that every item has a different story, so we’ve made this tool as open to interpretation as possible so that you can include everything that is relevant. While the builder tool is extensive, institutions may still have questions for you. But after filling out the form, you should have a better understanding of your item(s) and how this process works so that you can navigate it with ease. 
                  
                  If you have any additional questions about the builder tool, let us know in the Contact page and we’ll do our best to answer your question.</p>
                  <h5>What Should I Include?</h5>
                  <p>As much as possible. “Relevant” information will vary between institutions depending on their collection policy and mission, so it’s better to have everything in one place so that you can reference it later. This includes any relevant documentation for your item. Anything that can give an institution a better understand of what they’re dealing with is a plus. 
                  
                  Things to include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Pictures of the Item(s)</li>
                    <li>Ownership Documents</li>
                    <li>Repair Records</li>
                    <li>Record of Authenticity</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Institutional Use</h3>
                  <p>How can I use Donation Resume to make my donation process easier? How will this improve accessibility and diversity in my collection?</p>
                  <h5>Lack of Resources</h5>
                  <p>With every passing year, the number of items that could fall under your collection scope increases. Maybe your institution is growing faster than your storage facility, maybe your collection back-log is piling up, maybe you’re struggling to find the items that tell the most complete story of your community. With so many items to consider and so many stories to tell, it is imperative that your donation process be efficient and simple. If your institution is working with a smaller staff, freeing up your resources can massively help you reach your goals and focus on the needs of your community.
                  
                  Lengthy and inconsistent donation processes can also discourage donors. In many cases, donations come from donors who are already close to your organization or come from a culture of museum beneficiaries. Making your process more accessible will not only bring new members of your community into your institution, but it will improve your collections diversity and it’s ability to tell a more complete story.</p>
                  <h5>Adopt Donation Resume</h5>
                  <p>With Donation Resume, you don’t have to create this donation process yourself. Our Resume Builder tool helps donors explain the importance of their item(s) while better preparing them for the process and the questions they’ll be asked. Our tools can be applied to nearly every type of repository, so many of your questions and concerns can be covered in one well-formatted, comprehensive document. Informed donors and comprehensive documentation will save you time and resources, eliminating the need for a lengthy back-and-forth of emails and meetings for your already busy staff.
                  
                  Whether your process is already established or you're starting from scratch, incorporating Donation Builder can save you time and simplify your process. Just link our website in your donation page, form, or simply send it to prospective donors.
                  
                  If you have any questions or suggestions on how Donation Resume could work for your institution, you can reach us on our Contact page.</p>

                  <h3>Diversity</h3>
                  <p>How can institutions improve their diversity? What has led to a lack of diversity? What role do collections play?</p>
                  <p>Diversity remains a struggle for most institutions. Barriers for entry exist not only for potential workers, but visitors, too. As institutions work to ensure that all members of their community have a place there, they must also make space in their own collections for their diverse stories and experiences. If the collection does not tell a rich, accurate story, how well is it serving its community?
                  
                  Different institutions feel the consequences of a lack of diversity in different ways. What is consistent is that every institution has had to come to terms with this and actively work towards change at all levels. Removing barriers and changing institutional cultures is no easy task, but nonetheless necessary and long overdue. One of the simplest ways to work towards a goal of diversity is to bring more people to the table, to listen to the stories of their audience, and to encourage more engagement in their collections and their programs. This starts with a hard look at the barriers that exist in reaching out and getting involved. Simplifying the process will ensure that more people are able to take part, and ultimately it will improve the ability of the institution to connect with their visitors. 
                  
                  Donation Resume seeks to not only improve the efficiency of museum collection processes, but also to ensure that the process is accessible to all. Our tools are designed to give anyone the tools they need to give back to their communities. Informed, active donors make for better institutions, collections, and communities.</p>

                  <h3>Types of Institutions</h3>
                  <p>There are many different types of collections-based institutions. You know them as libraries, museums, galleries, research institutions, and more. Simply put, these are all organizations (usually non-profits) that use artifacts to tell stories. </p>
                  <h5>Museums</h5>
                  <p>Museums come in all shapes and sizes. All of them collect artifacts or works and use them to educate the public. Museums can focus on art, science, or history, and their collections can include anything from photos to whole buildings. The focus of a museum's collection is called it's scope. This specifies what kinds of items they take and what stories they want to tell. Most museums have a very specific scope, so that each one can tell their own stories as best as possible. Plus,  institutions have a finite amount of space, so they have to be specific with the items they want to take.</p>
                  <h5>Libraries</h5>
                  <p>Libraries are just museums for books, but with a few exceptions. For one, members of the community can check books out and read them. For this reason, their main goal is to have as many relevant books for their community in the best shape possible. While there are some libraries that deal in rare or historical books, most are more interested in the book's contents than it's appearance or monetary value.</p>
                  <h5>Research Institutions</h5>
                  <p>Here there will likely be some crossovers between research institutions and museums and libraries. This category is meant to encompass institutions that use artifacts primarily for research rather than display. Instead of a traditional history or art museum, think about an arboretum, a botanical garden, a zoo. These institutions are slightly different because their collections are used for different purposes, and often times their artifacts are alive! These institutions are still interested in items that a museum or library would take, but their focus is more on scientific research rather than exhibitions.</p>

                  <h3>Item Use</h3>
                  <p>How do these institutions use items that are donated? Most artifact use falls under these categories:</p>
                  <h5>Exhibition</h5>
                  <p>This would likely be the most obvious use of items in an institution. Items are put on display, usually with information cards and labels that tell its story in relation to a larger topic. These items are displayed and handled very carefully to ensure that they aren't damaged during exhibition. Some exhibits are on display at all times, with a few items being switched out here and there to shake things up. Other temporary exhibits are only up for a few weeks or months. When institutions are building exhibits, they search their collections for items that tell that story. When an exhibit is taken down or switched out, those items go back into protected storage.</p>
                  <h5>Research</h5>
                  <p>Items are brought into institutions because they believe that there is something that they can learn from the item. An exhibit is a great way to do this on a massive scale, but what if a researcher needs to look at that item to study it? Libraries let people study their collections all the time, but other institutions do this only under certain circumstances. These institutions are protecting these objects so that 50 years from now, these items can still be researched and viewed by anyone who needs to.</p>
                  <h5>Education</h5>
                  <p>All items are used for education in one way or another, but this category is meant to highlight a more hands-on approach. If an institution has many of the same objects, or if the item isn't especially rare, they can use the item for hands-on learning or practice. For example, maybe museum workers want to practice handling or labeling items that are less rare before they handle more fragile items. Maybe a book in a library is so rare that instead of loaning the original, they loan lesser copies or facsimiles so that the original is not damaged. For this reason, something doesn't necessarily have to be rare or pristine for an institution to use it.</p>
                  <h5>Conditions of Use</h5>
                  <p>In some cases, donors can request what kinds of things can happen to their donated item(s). Suppose someone only wants to lend their item for one temporary exhibit. Maybe they want their item to be kept in perpetuity rather than sold or traded later. Maybe they want their item to be used for research, but not for exhibits because there is personal information attached to the item. Institutions will work with donors to ensure that they respect their wishes. However if there are too many special requests or strings attached, institutions may decide not to accept the item.</p>

                  <p>Where do I start? What do I need to know? What questions should I ask?</p>
                  <h5>Choosing an Institution</h5>
                  <p>Donation Builder will not only help you compile all your information in one place, but it will also help you better understand your collection and where to donate it. Once you know the Type of Institution you want to donate to, start shopping around. Study the institution’s website to learn about its mission, policies and what kinds of items they’re looking for. Now that you’ve completed your Donation Resume, it will be easier to find places that are already telling similar stories to yours. 
                  
                  Also consider choosing a few different institutions you’re interested in. They will all operate off of a collection policy, which specifies what stories, types of items, eras, and subjects they cover. These are meant to be very specific – they only have so much space and so many resources.</p>
                  <h5>Decision Process</h5>
                  <p>Once you've chosen an institution, check their website for donation information. Larger institutions may have a form for you to fill out, while smaller institutions may just have contact information for their collection manager. Typically the process includes sending your information and waiting for a response, followed by a meeting to discuss your donation and go over any questions.
                  
                  Once institutions receive your information, they will pass it on to their collection review board. This can range from a formal committee to one person depending on the size of the institution. The institution will request to meet and see the actual item(s), and some may want to take temporary custody of the item while they make a decision. The decision process may go on for a while if they are dealing with a lot of donations at the moment. Donation Resume is meant to save you time by submitting everything all in one place. They will likely still have some questions, but most of the basic ones have already been covered by the questions on the Donation Resume form.
                  
                  During this process, here are some questions you should ask:
                    <ul>
                      <li>What are the terms on the deed of gift (the document that records your donation and legal ownership)? </li>
                      <li>Will you have to ask permission or pay a usage fee to access the item(s) later?</li>
                      <li>Will the institution process your collection in a timely manner, and making it available to researchers in person or online in a digital format?</li>
                      <li>What does the institution request regarding intellectual property rights to the donated items, digital rights and other issues? Is their request acceptable to you and your family? Where will your stories appear? Will you have any control over aspects of the story?</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <h5>Next Steps</h5>
                  <p>If the institution decides that they are interested in your donation, they will begin discussing the deed of gift. This is a legal document that transfers ownership of the item(s) to the institution. Terms will differ, so make sure you understand your rights to the item(s) and how the information will be displayed. The deed of gift will also have a section where you can outline your wishes for the item. This can include whether or not you want the donation to be returned to you if they do not accept it or discard it later on.  Institutions have to go through their collections periodically and clean out item they no longer want or need in a process called deaccessioning. If you selects the return option, they will make arrangements for you to pick it up or for them to ship it back at your expense. Otherwise, they are free to discard or transfer the item to another institution if they see fit.
                  
                  After you transfer ownership of the item(s), it will be cataloged, photographed, and prepared for exhibition or storage. Your name, as donor, will be linked to the piece in the collection database. If the item will be included in an exhibition, or if it requires restoration, their staff will take care of that. They may create a display label that credits you for the donation, but you can request to be anonymous.
                  
                  If the institution does not accept your donation, start contacting another one. Institutions only have so much space and so many resources. It is not possible for them to take everything so don’t take this personally. Some institutions may even help you locate another collector or institution to contact.</p>

                  <p>Can I claim a tax deduction on my donation? What is an appraisal?</p>
                  <h5>Tax Deductions</h5>
                  <p>In certain circumstances, it may be possible you to take a tax deduction for your donation. Keep in mind, institutions cannot give tax advice, nor are they permitted to appraise the monetary value of items that are under consideration for donation to their institution. They may be able to provide you with a list of appraisers who can (for a fee) make monetary appraisals. It is up to you, as the donor, to arrange and pay for any such appraisal. Speak with your tax accountant or attorney about this possibility.
                  
                  Appraisals are assessments made regarding the monetary value of an item. Appraisers are usually certified experts in the field they work in and are meant to stand as a reliable third party so that the value is accurate and unbiased. The appraiser may also require a certificate of authenticity or other record that validates your item is genuine or real. Authentications are those statements made that validate the genuine-ness of a given object, based on the expertise of that individual making the statement.
