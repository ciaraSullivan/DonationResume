                  <h4>Types of Institutions</h4>
                  <p>There are many different types of collections-based institutions. You know them as libraries, museums, galleries, research institutions, and more. Simply put, these are all organizations (usually non-profits) that use artifacts to tell stories. </p>
                  <h6>Museums</h6>
                  <p>Museums come in all shapes and sizes. All of them collect artifacts or works and use them to educate the public. Museums can focus on art, science, or history, and their collections can include anything from photos to whole buildings. The focus of a museum's collection is called it's scope. This specifies what kinds of items they take and what story they're trying to tell. Most museums have pretty specific scopes, so that each one can tell their own story as best as possible. Plus, any institution has a finite amount of space, so they have to be specific with the items they want to take.</p>
                  <h6>Libraries</h6>
                  <p>Libraries are just museums for books, but with a few exceptions. For one, members of the community can check books out and read them. For this reason, their main goal is to have as many relevant books for their community in the best shape possible. While there are some libraries that deal in rare or historical books, most are more interested in the book's contents than it's appearance or value.</p>
                  <h6>Research Institutions</h6>
                  <p>Here there will likely be some crossovers between research institutions and museums and libraries. This category is meant to encompass institutions that use artifacts primarily for research rather than display. Instead of a traditional history or art museum, think about an arboretum, a botanical garden, a zoo. These institutions are slightly different because their collections are used for different purposes, and often times their artifacts are alive! These institutions are still interested in items that a museum or library would take, but their focus is more on scientific research rather than community education.</p>

                  <h4>Item Use</h4>
                  <p>How do these institutions use items that are donated? Most artifact use falls under these categories:</p>
                  <h6>Exhibition</h6>
                  <p>This would likely be the most obvious use of items in an institution. Items are put on display, usually with information cards and labels that tell its story in relation to a larger topic. These items are displayed and handled very carefully to ensure that they aren't damaged during exhibition. Some exhibits are on display at all times, with a few items being switched out here and there to shake things up. Other temporary exhibits are only up for a few weeks or months. When institutions are building exhibits, they search their collections for items that tell that story. When an exhibit is taken down or switched out, those items go back into protected storage.</p>
                  <h6>Research</h6>
                  <p>Items are brought into institutions because they believe that there is something they can learn from the item. An exhibit is a great way to do this on a massive scale, but what if a researcher needs to look at that item to study it? Libraries let people study their collections all the time, but other institutions do this too under certain circumstances. These institutions are protecting these objects so that 50 years from now, these items can still be researched and viewed by anyone who needs to.</p>
                  <h6>Education</h6>
                  <p>All items are used for education in one way or another, but this category is meant to highlight a more hands-on approach. If an institution has many of the same objects, or if the item isn't especially rare, they can use the item for hands-on learning or practice. For example, maybe museum workers want to practice handling or labeling items that are less rare before they handle more fragile items. Maybe a book in a library is so rare that instead of loaning the original, they loan lesser copies or facsimiles so that the original is not damaged. For this reason, something doesn't necessarily have to be rare or pristine for an institution to use it.</p>
                  <h6>Conditions of Use</h6>
                  <p>In some cases, donors can request what kinds of things can happen to their donated item. Suppose someone only wants to lend their item for one temporary exhibit. Maybe they want their item to be kept in perpetuity rather than sold or traded later. Maybe they want their item to be used for research, but not for exhibits in case there is personal information of the donor attached to the item. Institutions will work with donors to ensure that they respect their wishes. However if there are too many special requests or strings attached, institutions may decide not to accept the item.</p>

                  <h4>Item Use</h4>
                  <p>How do these institutions use items that are donated? Most artifact use falls under these categories:</p>
                  <h6>Exhibition</h6>
                  <p>This would likely be the most obvious use of items in an institution. Items are put on display, usually with information cards and labels that tell its story in relation to a larger topic. These items are displayed and handled very carefully to ensure that they aren't damaged during exhibition. Some exhibits are on display at all times, with a few items being switched out here and there to shake things up. Other temporary exhibits are only up for a few weeks or months. When institutions are building exhibits, they search their collections for items that tell that story. When an exhibit is taken down or switched out, those items go back into protected storage.</p>
                  <h6>Research</h6>
                  <p>Items are brought into institutions because they believe that there is something they can learn from the item. An exhibit is a great way to do this on a massive scale, but what if a researcher needs to look at that item to study it? Libraries let people study their collections all the time, but other institutions do this too under certain circumstances. These institutions are protecting these objects so that 50 years from now, these items can still be researched and viewed by anyone who needs to.</p>
                  <h6>Education</h6>
                  <p>All items are used for education in one way or another, but this category is meant to highlight a more hands-on approach. If an institution has many of the same objects, or if the item isn't especially rare, they can use the item for hands-on learning or practice. For example, maybe museum workers want to practice handling or labeling items that are less rare before they handle more fragile items. Maybe a book in a library is so rare that instead of loaning the original, they loan lesser copies or facsimiles so that the original is not damaged. For this reason, something doesn't necessarily have to be rare or pristine for an institution to use it.</p>
                  <h6>Conditions of Use</h6>
                  <p>In some cases, donors can request what kinds of things can happen to their donated item. Suppose someone only wants to lend their item for one temporary exhibit. Maybe they want their item to be kept in perpetuity rather than sold or traded later. Maybe they want their item to be used for research, but not for exhibits in case there is personal information of the donor attached to the item. Institutions will work with donors to ensure that they respect their wishes. However if there are too many special requests or strings attached, institutions may decide not to accept the item.</p>
